    <h2>What is a Thread?</h2>
    <p>A thread is a lightweight process that can run concurrently with other threads. It allows your application to perform tasks simultaneously, improving efficiency and responsiveness.</p>

    <h2>Using Threads in PHP</h2>
    <p>While PHP doesn't support multi-threading in the traditional sense, you can use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Process Control Functions</strong> to create child processes.</li>
        <li><strong>Asynchronous Programming</strong> using libraries.</li>
        <li><strong>AJAX</strong> for background tasks in web apps.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Here's a simple way to start a drawing task using threads:</p>
    <pre>
<code>
function startDrawing() {
    // Start your drawing operation here
}
</code>
    </pre>

    <h2>More Information</h2>
    <p>For more details, refer to PHP's documentation on threading and process control.</p>
